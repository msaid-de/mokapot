    """
    Computes the empirical p-values for a set of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : np.ndarray[float | int]
        Array of data values/test statistics (typically scores) for which
        p-values are to be computed.

    s0 : np.ndarray[float | int]
        Array of data values (scores) simulated under the null hypothesis
        against which the data values `s` are to be compared.

    mode : str
        Can be one of "unbiased", "conservative", or "storey". Default is
        "conservative".
        "unbiased" means to use $r/n$ as an estimator, where $r$ is the rank of
        the data value in the array of simulated samples. This is an unbiased
        and good when the data value is a concrete value, and not sampled.
        $conservative$ means $(r+1)/(n+1)$ which is a slightly biased, but
        conservative when the data values are sampled from the null
        distribution, in which case it is to be preferred.
        $storey$ is similar to "unbiased" but includes the "hack" for $r=0$
        found in the implementation of the `qvalue` package. It is neither
        completely unbiased nor convervative.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray[float]
        Array of empirical p-values corresponding to the input data array `s`.
